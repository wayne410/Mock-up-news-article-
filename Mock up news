            <p>Mandaluyong City, Philippines â€“ Four teenagers, aged 17 to 18, have been reported missing after entering the infamous "Old Ramirez Building," a long-abandoned structure rumored to be haunted.</p>
            <p>The group was last seen five days ago by witnesses who claim they entered the building late at night, possibly as part of an exploration or dare. However, they have not been heard from since, and authorities say they have mysteriously vanished without a trace.</p>
            <p>Police have conducted multiple searches within the building but have not found any traces of the missing individuals. "We are exploring all possibilities, including foul play and paranormal activities, given the building's eerie history," a spokesperson said.</p>
            <p>Local residents have long believed that the building is cursed, with stories of strange noises, disappearing objects, and shadowy figures circulating for years. "No one goes in there after dark," one resident told CNN. "I hope those kids are okay."</p>
            <p>Authorities urge the public to stay away from the area and report any information that could lead to the missing teens.</p>
